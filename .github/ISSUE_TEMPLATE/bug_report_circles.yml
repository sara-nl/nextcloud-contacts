        ### üëçThanks for reporting issues back to Nextcloud!
        This is the issue tracker of Nextcloud, if you have any support question please check out [the support on our website](https://nextcloud.com/support).

        ‚ö† Please report only issues corresponding to the contacts app for Nextcloud ‚ö†

        Migration and CardDAV issues belong in the [server repo](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues)!

        If you have any questions, head over to the [forum](https://help.nextcloud.com/c/apps/contacts)!

        Note that Nextcloud is an open source project backed by Nextcloud GmbH. Most of our volunteers are home users and thus primarily care about issues that affect home users. Our paid engineers prioritize issues of our customers. If you are neither a home user nor a customer, consider paying somebody to fix your issue, do it yourself or become a customer.
